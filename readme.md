#### First Program & Second Program
Written on TI-nspire CAS calculator. First Program was written for physics class because I 
didn't see the point at calculating special relativity values of the same calculations for 
different inputs over and over. Somehow stumbled across the calculators programming language 
TI-BASIC which is built in (a friend may have pointed it out) and managed to come up with my 
first program. My physics teacher was impressed and confused because in the end, most of my 
assignment was just printed out code. I'm not sure that he read it in the end. 

The second program must have been a similar situation for Maths B, to check values of a given 
function are either a minimum, maximum or HPOI.
